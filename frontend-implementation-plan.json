        "When isHardwareConnected is false, all data panels are hidden and replaced with a 'Waiting for hardware connection...' placeholder",

        "Frontend polls isHardwareConnected every 3 seconds and automatically reveals panels without requiring a page refresh",
        "The SimulationControl (manual advance) is also hidden in the waiting state so users cannot inject fake data before hardware connects"

Ensure the conditional rendering wraps the entire content area while keeping the overall layout structure intact."

Use Tailwind utility classes from the existing theme (oklch colors, glow effects, pulse animation). The component should fill the available space and center its content both vertically and horizontally. Include a subtle scanline overlay effect consistent with the existing dashboard aesthetic."
