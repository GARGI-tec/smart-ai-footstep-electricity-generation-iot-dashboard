  "summary": "Final year engineering project: Smart AI Footstep Electricity Generation using IoT. A web dashboard app that displays AI-driven energy management from footstep-powered generators. The dashboard should show blank/empty state until real hardware is connected and sending data. Features IoT sensor data display, AI smart energy routing, overcharge prevention, time-of-day pattern learning, and energy flow visualization. Includes an HTTP API endpoint for real hardware (Arduino/ESP32/Raspberry Pi) to send sensor data.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "AI logic rules implemented client-side: if battery > 90%, route power directly to devices; store energy during peak hours; draw from storage during low traffic",
    "Dashboard displays blank/empty state by default — no simulated data. Data only appears when real hardware sends readings via HTTP POST to the backend API endpoint."
