  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements comprehensively. REQ-1 is fulfilled by SimulationControl.tsx showing 'NO DEVICE CONNECTED' with a WifiOff icon and muted grey styling. REQ-2 is fulfilled by useQueries.ts returning null values (not hardcoded mock data) for all sensor fields when no reading exists. REQ-3 is fulfilled by all eight named panel components (SensorDataPanel, SensorReadingCards, AnalyticsCharts, BatteryLevelPanel, USBOutputStatusPanel, AIDecisionPanel, EnergyFlowDiagram, HexagonTilePanel) displaying placeholder states instead of zeroed-out values when data is null/absent.",
