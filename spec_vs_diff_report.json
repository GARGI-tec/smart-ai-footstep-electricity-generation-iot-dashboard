  "summary": "Both REQ-9 and REQ-10 are fully implemented. The backend adds a hardwareConnected flag (defaulting to false), exposes isHardwareConnected query, and sets the flag when hardware POSTs data. The frontend polls every 3 seconds via useHardwareConnectionStatus, conditionally renders HardwareWaitingState when not connected, and hides all panels (SensorDataPanel, AIDecisionPanel, EnergyFlowDiagram, AnalyticsCharts, SimulationControl) until hardware connects. The waiting state uses the existing neon amber/cyan industrial theme with pulsing animation.",

      "description": "A migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added to handle schema migration from old actor state to new actor state with the hardwareConnected field.",
      "reason": "The build request did not request any migration module or schema migration logic. It only requested adding a flag and exposing a query. While potentially useful, this was not specified in the requirements.",
